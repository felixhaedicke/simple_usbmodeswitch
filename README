simple_usbmodeswitch

Simple USB mode switcher for switching Huawei Hi-Link devices from its default
mass storage mode to network device mode.

It is a lightweight, alternative for usb_modeswitch without any configuration
files, but for Huawei devices with USB vendor id 12d1 and product id 1f01 only.
Use usb_modeswitch, if you need to perform mode switching for other devices.

You might want to add a udev rule like this to perform mode switching when a
supported device is plugged in:
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="12d1", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1f01", RUN+="/usr/bin/simple_modeswitch"
